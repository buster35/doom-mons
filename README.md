# Welcome to My Portfolio

## Description & Usage

Hello, this is (and will continue to be) my updated portfolio in a single webpage form. The goal of the deployed page is to show potential employers or other possible clients a "snapshot" of my most recent development projects.

The page is simple so as to not overload the visitor; however, if the user so chooses they can click on the splash images of my completed projects which will lead them to a new page displaying said project.

There's also a footer section containing contact information. Thanks for visiting! - Zach
